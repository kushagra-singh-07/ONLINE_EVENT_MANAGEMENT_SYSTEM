Java Swing + JDBC + Servlet (Review-2)
📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Event Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed using Java Swing for the user interface and JDBC for database interaction with MySQL.

The system allows users to:

Register customers
Select different types of events
Enter event-specific details
Calculate pricing dynamically
Process and store payments
For Review-2, the project has been extended with a Servlet-based controller layer to demonstrate MVC architecture and server-side request handling.

🎯 REVIEW-2 EVALUATION FOCUS
This project is designed to satisfy all Review-2 assessment criteria:

Servlet Implementation
Code Quality & Execution
Innovation / Extra Effort
Each criterion is explained below.

1️⃣ SERVLET IMPLEMENTATION (CONTROLLER LAYER)
✔ SERVLET USED
BookingServlet extends HttpServlet
Uses @WebServlet("/bookEvent") annotation
Implements both doPost() and doGet() methods
✔ PURPOSE OF SERVLET
The servlet acts as the Controller layer:

Receives request parameters (name, phone, address)
Processes incoming client requests
Interacts with CustomerDAO
Sends response back to client
This demonstrates server-side logic even though the application is primarily desktop-based.

✔ SERVLET HIGHLIGHTS
Uses Jakarta Servlet API 6.1.0
Proper use of HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse
Exception handling inside servlet lifecycle methods
Clean controller logic
✔ MVC ARCHITECTURE
View : Java Swing Forms Controller : BookingServlet Model : Event classes + CustomerDAO Database : MySQL (JDBC)

The servlet is included specifically to satisfy Review-2 servlet implementation marks.

2️⃣ CODE QUALITY & EXECUTION
✔ CLEAN ARCHITECTURE
DAO Pattern used for database operations
Clear separation of concerns:
UI Layer : Swing Forms
Business Logic : Event classes
Data Access : CustomerDAO
Controller : Servlet
✔ OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN
Abstract base class: Event

Child classes:

MarriageEvent
BirthdayEvent
EngagementEvent
BabyShowerEvent
AnniversaryEvent
Method overriding used for:

calculatePrice()
extraDetails()
✔ INPUT VALIDATION
Centralized validation using ValidationUtils
Strict date & time parsing
Phone number and numeric validation
User-friendly error messages
✔ JDBC BEST PRACTICES
Prepared Statements (prevents SQL injection)
Auto-generated keys retrieved safely
Proper exception handling
Graceful fallback when DB connection fails
✔ THREAD SAFETY
PaymentProcessor uses synchronized method
Simulates real-world payment processing behavior
3️⃣ INNOVATION / EXTRA EFFORT
⭐ ADVANCED UI FEATURES
Custom placeholder text fields
Multi-page navigation flow
Clean and intuitive Swing UI
Dynamic form rendering per event type
⭐ DYNAMIC PRICING LOGIC
Event pricing is calculated dynamically based on:

Event type
Guest count
Years completed (Anniversary)
No hard-coded payment values are used.

⭐ REAL-WORLD SIMULATION
Payment delay simulation
Persistent storage for:
Customers
Events
Payments
Foreign key relationships with ON DELETE CASCADE
⭐ EXTENSIBLE DESIGN
New event types can be added easily
Servlet layer can be extended to web or REST APIs
🗄️DATABASE SCHEMA (MYSQL)
Tables:

customers
events
payments
Relational design with foreign keys ensures data consistency and integrity.

▶ HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
Ensure MySQL is running and database "eventdb" exists

Update DB credentials in DBConnection.java

Add required JAR files:

MySQL Connector/J
jakarta.servlet-api-6.1.0.jar
Compile and run:

javac EventManagementApp.java

java EventManagementApp
